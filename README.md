# REVV-Light tool

> Ambiguity and Incompleteness in User Story Requirements

This program extracts concepts and relationships from a User Story HTML report file obtained from the visual-narrator-adapted-for-revv tool and converts it into an interactive visualization that can be utilized for identifying terminological ambiguity and incompleteness in user story requirements.

## Installing
